# Campus Event Hub
Campus Event Hub is a web-based event management system designed for colleges and clubs to efficiently create, manage, and promote events. It provides a centralized platform for students and organizers to handle registrations, updates, and event notifications seamlessly.

## Problem

Students often miss academic or extracurricular events due to a lack of timely updates. manual announcements interrupt lectures and frequently fail to reach all students effectively, leading to reduced participation and missed opportunities for learning and engagement.

## Solution

Campus Event Hub solves this problem by offering a dedicated web application where:
- Organizers can create and manage events with details like date, time, venue, and description.
- Students can browse upcoming events and register directly on the platform.
- A central dashboard allows users to view all upcoming and past events.
- Search and filter features make it easy to find events based on categories, dates, or popularity.

This ensures better communication, higher participation, and smoother event management across campus.
